## Overview

This project is a full-stack application written in Python, leveraging Streamlit and FastAPI frameworks. It features a map-based interface on the front end and a backend with two endpoints. The application performs an API call to the International Space Station (ISS) to retrieve its current location and sends this information back to the front end, where it is visualized on a map.

The main components of the project include:
- Frontend: Built with Streamlit, the application provides an interactive map interface where users can view the real-time location of the ISS.
- Backend: Utilizing FastAPI. The main endpoint fetches the ISS location data through an API call.

The combination of Docker and Jenkins facilitates the seamless deployment and automation of this microservice architecture. Dockerfiles and Docker Compose are utilized for containerization and deployment, while a containerized Jenkins Pipelines with a Jenkinsfile define the CI/CD processes.

##  Set-up

1. First clone the repository to your local system :

``` git clone https://github.com/adamK563/DevOpsProject```

2. Then to start the application simply write the command : 

``` docker-compose up ```

this will create 3 containers for frontend, backend and jenkins.

- To enter the Backend FastAPI UI - open your browser and enter the URL : 

   ``` localhost:8000/docs ```

- To enter the Frontend UI - open your browser and enter the URL : 

   ``` localhost:8501 ```

- To enter the Jenkins Pipeline/Jobs - open your browser and enter the URL : 

    ``` localhost:8080 ```
